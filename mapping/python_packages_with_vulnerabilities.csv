https://data.siemens-energy.com/cybersec/cve/CVE-2025-21688,"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

drm/v3d: Assign job pointer to NULL before signaling the fence

In commit e4b5ccd392b9 (""drm/v3d: Ensure job pointer is set to NULL
after job completion""), we introduced a change to assign the job pointer
to NULL after completing a job, indicating job completion.

However, this approach created a race condition between the DRM
scheduler workqueue and the IRQ execution thread. As soon as the fence is
signaled in the IRQ execution thread, a new job starts to be executed.
This results in a race condition where the IRQ execution thread sets the
job pointer to NULL simultaneously as the `run_job()` function assigns
a new job to the pointer.

This race condition can lead to a NULL pointer dereference if the IRQ
execution thread sets the job pointer to NULL after `run_job()` assigns
it to the new job. When the new job completes and the GPU emits an
interrupt, `v3d_irq()` is triggered, potentially causing a crash.

This string concatenation is done unsafely and without escaping or encoding the user input. This allows an user, in many cases, to inject arbitrary parameters into the URI string. These parameters can be potentially dangerous depending on the libraries used. One of these dangerous parameters is `allowAllFiles` in the library `github.com/go-sql-driver/mysql`. Should this be set to `true`, the library enables running the `LOAD DATA LOCAL INFILE` query on any file on the host machine (in this case, the machine that WhoDB is running on). By injecting `&allowAllFiles=true` into the connection URI and connecting to any MySQL server (such as an attacker-controlled one), the attacker is able to read local files.

This crash is caused by a confusion in the ASN.1 library itself which assumes that certain objects can only be provided in either constructed or primitive forms, and will trigger a preconditionFailure if that constraint isn't met.

Importantly, these constraints are actually required to be true in DER, but that correctness wasn't enforced on the early node parser side so it was incorrect to rely on it later on in decoding, which is what the library did.

These crashes can be triggered when parsing any DER/BER format object. There is no memory-safety issue here: the crash is a graceful one from the Swift runtime.

[CAUSE]
The reproducer is using a corrupted image where extent tree root is
corrupted, thus forcing to use ""rescue=all,ro"" mount option to mount the
image.

Then it triggered a scrub, but since scrub relies on extent tree to find
where the data/metadata extents are, scrub_find_fill_first_stripe()
relies on an non-empty extent root.

But unfortunately scrub_find_fill_first_stripe() doesn't really expect
an NULL pointer for extent root, it use extent_root to grab fs_info and
triggered a NULL pointer dereference.

[FIX]
Add an extra check for a valid extent root at the beginning of
scrub_find_fill_first_stripe().

The new error path is introduced by 42437a6386ff (""btrfs: introduce
mount option rescue=ignorebadroots""), but that's pretty old, and later
commit b979547513ff (""btrfs: scrub: introduce helper to find and fill
sector info for a scrub_stripe"") changed how we do scrub.

So for kernels older than 6.6, the fix will need manual backport.",fs,https://data.siemens-energy.com/cybersec/package/fs

				kernfs_put_active

This warning is caused by 'kernfs_break_active_protection' when it is
writing to cpuset.cpus, and the cgroup is removed concurrently.

The commit 3a5a6d0c2b03 (""cpuset: don't nest cgroup_mutex inside
get_online_cpus()"") made cpuset_hotplug_workfn asynchronous, This change
involves calling flush_work(), which can create a multiple processes
circular locking dependency that involve cgroup_mutex, potentially leading
to a deadlock. To avoid deadlock. the commit 76bb5ab8f6e3 (""cpuset: break
kernfs active protection in cpuset_write_resmask()"") added
'kernfs_break_active_protection' in the cpuset_write_resmask. This could
lead to this warning.

After the commit 2125c0034c5d (""cgroup/cpuset: Make cpuset hotplug
processing synchronous""), the cpuset_write_resmask no longer needs to
wait the hotplug to finish, which means that concurrent hotplug and cpuset
operations are no longer possible. Therefore, the deadlock doesn't exist
anymore and it does not have to 'break active protection' now. To fix this
warning, just remove kernfs_break_active_protection operation in the
'cpuset_write_resmask'.",fs,https://data.siemens-energy.com/cybersec/package/fs

mptcp: sysctl: sched: avoid using current->nsproxy

Using the 'net' structure via 'current' is not recommended for different
reasons.

First, if the goal is to use it to read or write per-netns data, this is
inconsistent with how the ""generic"" sysctl entries are doing: directly
by only using pointers set to the table entry, e.g. table->data. Linked
to that, the per-netns data should always be obtained from the table
linked to the netns it had been created for, which may not coincide with
the reader's or writer's netns.

Another reason is that access to current->nsproxy->netns can oops if
attempted when current->nsproxy had been dropped when the current task
is exiting. This is what syzbot found, when using acct(2):

https://data.siemens-energy.com/cybersec/cve/CVE-2025-21643,"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

netfs: Fix kernel async DIO

Netfslib needs to be able to handle kernel-initiated asynchronous DIO that
is supplied with a bio_vec[] array.  Currently, because of the async flag,
this gets passed to netfs_extract_user_iter() which throws a warning and
fails because it only handles IOVEC and UBUF iterators.  This can be
triggered through a combination of cifs and a loopback blockdev with
something like:

        mount //my/cifs/share /foo
        dd if=/dev/zero of=/foo/m0 bs=4K count=1K
        losetup --sector-size 4096 --direct-io=on /dev/loop2046 /foo/m0
        echo hello >/dev/loop2046

This causes the following to appear in syslog:

        WARNING: CPU: 2 PID: 109 at fs/netfs/iterator.c:50 netfs_extract_user_iter+0x170/0x250 [netfs]

and the write to fail.

Fix this by removing the check in netfs_unbuffered_write_iter_locked() that
causes async kernel DIO writes to be handled as userspace writes.  Note
that this change relies on the kernel caller maintaining the existence of
the bio_vec array (or kvec[] or folio_queue) until the op is complete.",fs,https://data.siemens-energy.com/cybersec/package/fs

afs: Fix the maximum cell name length

The kafs filesystem limits the maximum length of a cell to 256 bytes, but a
problem occurs if someone actually does that: kafs tries to create a
directory under /proc/net/afs/ with the name of the cell, but that fails
with a warning:

        WARNING: CPU: 0 PID: 9 at fs/proc/generic.c:405

because procfs limits the maximum filename length to 255.

However, the DNS limits the maximum lookup length and, by extension, the
maximum cell name, to 255 less two (length count and trailing NUL).

Fix this by limiting the maximum acceptable cellname length to 253.  This
also allows us to be sure we can create the ""/afs/.<cell>/"" mountpoint too.

Further, split the YFS VL record cell name maximum to be the 256 allowed by
the protocol and ignore the record retrieved by YFSVL.GetCellName if it
exceeds 253.",fs,https://data.siemens-energy.com/cybersec/package/fs

ovl: support encoding fid from inode with no alias

Dmitry Safonov reported that a WARN_ON() assertion can be trigered by
userspace when calling inotify_show_fdinfo() for an overlayfs watched
inode, whose dentry aliases were discarded with drop_caches.

The WARN_ON() assertion in inotify_show_fdinfo() was removed, because
it is possible for encoding file handle to fail for other reason, but
the impact of failing to encode an overlayfs file handle goes beyond
this assertion.

As shown in the LTP test case mentioned in the link below, failure to
encode an overlayfs file handle from a non-aliased inode also leads to
failure to report an fid with FAN_DELETE_SELF fanotify events.

As Dmitry notes in his analyzis of the problem, ovl_encode_fh() fails
if it cannot find an alias for the inode, but this failure can be fixed.
ovl_encode_fh() seldom uses the alias and in the case of non-decodable
file handles, as is often the case with fanotify fid info,
ovl_encode_fh() never needs to use the alias to encode a file handle.

Defer finding an alias until it is actually needed so ovl_encode_fh()
will not fail in the common case of FAN_DELETE_SELF fanotify events.",fs,https://data.siemens-energy.com/cybersec/package/fs

gpio: virtuser: fix missing lookup table cleanups

When a virtuser device is created via configfs and the probe fails due
to an incorrect lookup table, the table is not removed. This prevents
subsequent probe attempts from succeeding, even if the issue is
corrected, unless the device is released. Additionally, cleanup is also
needed in the less likely case of platform_device_register_full()
failure.

Besides, a consistent memory leak in lookup_table->dev_id was spotted
using kmemleak by toggling the live state between 0 and 1 with a correct
lookup table.

existing gpio_virtuser_make_lookup_table() and call it from all
necessary points to ensure proper cleanup.",fs,https://data.siemens-energy.com/cybersec/package/fs

Since commit 5cbcb62dddf5 (""fs/proc: fix softlockup in __read_vmcore"") the
number of softlockups in __read_vmcore at kdump time have gone down, but
they still happen sometimes.

In a memory constrained environment like the kdump image, a softlockup is
not just a harmless message, but it can interfere with things like RCU
freeing memory, causing the crashdump to get stuck.

The second loop in __read_vmcore has a lot more opportunities for natural
sleep points, like scheduling out while waiting for a data write to
happen, but apparently that is not always enough.

Prior to version 1.0.6, if an attacker can control the input to the `asteval` library, they can bypass asteval's restrictions and execute arbitrary Python code in the context of the application using the library. The vulnerability is rooted in how `asteval` performs handling of `FormattedValue` AST nodes. In particular, the `on_formattedvalue` value uses the dangerous format method of the str class. The code allows an attacker to manipulate the value of the string used in the dangerous call `fmt.format(__fstring__=val)`. This vulnerability can be exploited to access protected attributes by intentionally triggering an `AttributeError` exception. The attacker can then catch the exception and use its `obj` attribute to gain arbitrary access to sensitive or protected object properties.
